                GDSC CMRIT is a university-based community group for students interested in Google developer technologies. GDSC can take many forms-from just a few people getting together to watch some videos, to large gatherings with demos, tech talks, hackathons and conferences. We work on various technical domains and try to make use of Google Technologies to empower the audience around us.. By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their communities.
